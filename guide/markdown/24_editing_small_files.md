## 24: Editing small text files with nano

Nano is a lightweight editor installed on most Unix systems. There are many more powerful editors (such as 'emacs' and 'vi'), but these have steep learning curves. Nano is very simple. You can edit (or create) files by typing:

```bash
learner@:learning_unix$ nano opening_lines.txt
```

You simply type the text you want to include in the file.

The bottom of the nano window shows you a list of simple commands which are all accessible by typing 'Control' plus a letter. E.g. Control + X exits the program.
